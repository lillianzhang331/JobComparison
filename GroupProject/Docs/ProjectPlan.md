# Project Plan

**Author**: 6300Fall20Team030

## 1 Introduction
This project is for designing an android application that allows a user to make comparisons between a job offer and either their current job or another job offer. The user will have the option to adjust weights used in score calculations with attributes such as salary, benefits, and commute time.

## 2 Process Description
### Week 1- Software Design (Due 9/28 8am EST)
#### Individual UML class diagram designs
* Description: Each member of the team should create their own interpretation of the project requirements into a UML class diagram. The diagram should be accompanied by a design description addressing each requirement and how it is encompassed by their design. Upon completion, the team will come together to critique each design for their pros and cons.
* Entrance criteria: assignment requirements and project specifications
* Exit criteria: Individual UML class diagrams and design descriptions are uploaded to the team github

#### Team UML class diagram design
* Description: After reviewing the individual designs, collaborate with team members to create a team UML class diagram that everyone agrees with. Along with the design, members should write up a design description addressing how the team design fulfills each of the requirements. A separate discussion of each individual design’s pros/cons, design discussions, and summary should be written up and attached as well.
* Entrance criteria: individual UML class diagrams
* Exit criteria: Team UML class diagram, design description, and design discussion are uploaded to the team github

### Week 2- Inception and Elaboration (Due 10/5 8am EST)
#### Project plan
* Description: This plan outlines the project development process and roles of each team member.
* Entrance criteria: Semester schedule, assignment specifications
* Exit criteria: Project plan includes introduction, process descriptions (with entrance/exit criterias), and team descriptions (with roles). This plan is reviewed by all members and uploaded to team github.

#### Use case model
* Description: This model contains the use case diagram, which describes actors and use cases for the system, as well as the use case descriptions, which outline conditions and scenarios that take place in the application.
* Entrance criteria: Project specifications and understanding of user scenarios
* Exit criteria: Use case model includes most common scenarios and each should be accompanied with requirements, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and scenarios. The model is reviewed by all members and uploaded to the team github.

#### Extra requirements
* Description: Extra requirements include supplementary requirements that do not fit the use case model, such as non-functional requirements. These include those that pertain to UI and performance of the application.
* Entrance criteria: Use case model and assignment requirements
* Exit criteria: Extra requirements list include nonfunctional requirements and should be reviewed and uploaded to the team github.

#### Design document
* Description: The design document includes design considerations, which consists of assumptions, constraints, and the system environment. Secondly, it includes architectural design, consisting of a component diagram and a deployment diagram. Thirdly, it includes low level designs such as the class diagram and other necessary diagrams. Lastly, this document includes a user interface design that provides a layout of the user interface.
* Entrance criteria: Assignment requirements, knowledge of design and diagram concepts, UML class diagram/descrition from prior week, and diagraming tools (lucidchart, flow.io, etc)
* Exit criteria: Diagrams reflect the requirements outlined in the project and do not contradict each other. Diagrams and design considerations should be reviewed by all members and uploaded to the team github.

#### Test plan
* Description: The test plan outlines the steps our team will take to test our application. These include testing strategies and how to log bugs and requests.
* Entrance criteria: Knowledge about how to write test cases, assignment requirements, and testing software/tools (kanban board, jira, etc)
* Exit criteria: Plan should include information on testing strategy, test selection, adequacy criterion, bug tracking, testing technology, and test cases.This plan is reviewed by all members and uploaded to team github.

### Week 3- Construction (Due 10/12 8am EST)
#### Revision of earlier documents
* Description: This step allows the team to go back and revise previous documents and diagrams to reflect new requirements and/or design changes in the system.
* Entrance criteria: Completed documents from prior week
* Exit criteria: Updated documents should reflect any new changes.

#### Initial version of the app (alpha/beta release)
* Description: The initial version of the application should act as an alpha/beta release. The initial version should closely match the design plan created in the previous week and include most of the basic functionality.
* Entrance criteria: Design document, Android studio, Github, Java, UI design
* Exit criteria: Basic functionality should be included in the initial version. App should essentially “work” on its own, possibly without a completed UI or seamless flow.

#### Initial test plan results
* Description: These results reflect the execution of the test plan on the initial version of the application.
* Entrance criteria: Completed initial version of application, test plan from prior week, testing tools (Junit, selenium, etc)
* Exit criteria: Testing results are reported in an organized fashion, though may only include partial results

#### User manual
* Description: The user manual documents the app functionality from a user’s perspective.
* Entrance criteria: Completed initial app version
* Exit criteria: The user manual should be easy to read to a non technical audience and explain how to use the app.

### Week 4- Transition (Due 10/19 8am EST)
#### Revision of earlier documents
* Description: This step allows the team to go back and revise previous documents and diagrams to reflect new requirements and/or design changes in the system.
* Entrance criteria: Completed documents from prior week
* Exit criteria: Updated documents should reflect any new changes.

#### Final version of the app
* Description: This is the final version of the app. It should have all functionalities stated in the project requirements completed as well as a completed UI/UX flow.
* Entrance criteria: Initial version of the application, project requirements, Android studio, Github, Java, UI design
* Exit criteria: Entire application passes written test cases and follow all requirements stated in the project specifications

#### Final test plan results
* Description: These results reflect the execution of the final test plan on the final version of the application.
* Entrance criteria: Completed final version of application, test plan from prior week, testing tools (Junit, selenium, etc)
* Exit criteria: Testing results are reported in an organized fashion and all should reflect passing tests

## 3 Team
### Team members
* Lillian Zhang
* Mitesh Modi
* Olatokunbo Akanni
* Subramania Bharathi Ramamoorthy

### Roles
#### Project Lead
Project lead is responsible for scheduling and planning the project. They must be attentive to deadlines and deliverables, as well as making sure the team is adhering to the project plan.
#### Development lead
The development lead understands the workflow of the app development and allocates work to members accordingly. They should pay close attention to what features are being worked on at any given moment and manage feature branches in the repository.
#### UI/UX design lead
The UI/UX design lead is responsible for managing the overall front-end design of the project. They should make sure that the final product flows smoothly and visual components link up to backend components seamlessly.
#### QA lead
The QA lead is responsible for managing the overall testing of the application. This means identifying requirements that need to be tested and verifying that existing tests continuously pass with each additional feature.
#### Architect
The architect verifies that the system being created adheres to structural design of the project. This includes maintaining relationships between classes, consistency across multiple entities, and correct creation of objects.
