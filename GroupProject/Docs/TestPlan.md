# Test Plan

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

**Unit Testing:** This first level of testing is for the individual units or modules in isolation. We will perform unit tests on the functionality of our modules during the implementation process. All team members will be involved in writing the codes for the software, so all will be responsible for performing unit tests during the development process.

**Integration Testing:** This is the test of the interactions among different modules. This testing will be performed all at once (Big Bang testing) after the completion of all the modules and unit testing has been performed. This testing will be carried out by two members of the team.

**System Testing:** This is a test of the complete system as a whole, including both functional and nonfunctional testing.  This end-to-end testing will be used to test the flow whether the flow of the application is performing as designed from start to finish. This will involve testing all imaginable cases possible in the use of the application and it will be performed individually by all members of the team.

**Regression Testing:** This testing will be performed every time there is an update in the system to ensure any changes made will behave as intended and the unchanged code is not negatively affected by the modification. We will be using Github in the software development and testing, and any test scripts created to test at every stage of development will be saved and retrieved for reuse anytime an update is made. As with software testing, all team members will be involved in regression testing also.

### 1.2 Test Selection

We will use both white-box and black-box techniques to build our test cases. We will start with white-box techniques to set up our unit test cases for comprehensive test of functionalities at this level. This will be a concurrent process during the development phase. The white-box approach will also be applied for integration testing which tests the interaction between modules.

Majority of our test cases will be based on the black-box approach. This will be on the system testing level in which our test cases will be configured to check various features in fulfillment of the application requirements. In this level, the test cases will be focused on the output or response of system without any consideration or examination of code. If any error is discovered in the system testing level, then a white-box technique testing approach can be applied to identify the error in the code and resolve it.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The testing in the unit level will have a high degree of confidence given the simplicity of the modules. Given this, multiple unit test cases can be developed to reach maximum or near-maximum structural coverage.

Functional testing, in the system level, will be based on satisfying all requirements in the application description so our test cases will be designed to achieve 90-100% coverage at the end of testing.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

We will use GitHub Issues to track bugs and enhancement requests. Issues in a repository  is used to collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks. With this feature in GitHub, we will be able to track bugs and enhancement requests as issues and also organize tasks to handle them. Any issue will be appropriately titled, given an apt description, and label for easy recognition and tracking.
A pull request will be linked to an issue being worked on to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issues when someone merges the pull request.

### 1.5 Technology

We intend to use JUnit for our unit testing. This will be used in combination with Inspections technique (manual group activity). The combination of both would ensure systematic and thorough testing.
